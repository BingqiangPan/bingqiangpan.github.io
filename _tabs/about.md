# Bingqiang Pan

I am currently a 4th-semester master student in Chemical Biotechnology at Technical University of Munich (TUM). Before that, I earned my bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from Zhejiang University, China.

With a background in chemical engineering and biotechnology, I'm passionate about engineering solutions for biological challenges. I'm currently working on my master thesis, investigating how pressure influences the differentiation of stem cells encapsulated in alginate microgels.

In my spare time, I enjoy cycling, hiking, and photography. I'm also learning to play the electric guitar.
