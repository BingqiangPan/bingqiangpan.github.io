This is the very first post on my blog.

The original idea behind creating this space was simple: I wanted a permanent, cozy corner to collect the thoughts that pop into my mind. I've thought about using RedNote or WeChat, but I didn't want my ideas to be diluted by likes, reads, or random opinions from people I barely know. I also thought about building a personal website with its own domain and server, but I gave it up when knowing the annual cost and the formalities for examination and approval.

Two days ago, while browsing CC98, an internal forum of ZJU, I saw someone using personal GitHub site for lecture notes. I was inspired. I've been meaning to find a place to write down all my random thoughts about anything, especially for my experiments. Just this week alone, I've got a list: 

- How to stably generate alginate microgels using microfluidics? Why were there so many chunks in my last encapsulation?
- Why does my PLL coating and cell fixation always fail? Is it the PLL itself or just me?
- Why did my recent Live/Dead stainings look like a mess—same solution, totally different result?

I desperately need somewhere to write down my thoughts, the process of exploring each question, and the references that support my ideas. These aren’t publishable papers, just the kind of everyday problems any beginner in the field might run into. I want to document what *actually works*—because I’ve tested it myself.

Starting a blog here seems like a perfect idea. A place for research thoughts, guitar riffs, photo dumps, or even late-night thoughts about my future.

So I started figuring things out, with tutorials from Bilibili, GitHub, and ChatGPT — after four nights of trial-and-error, here it is: my very first post.
